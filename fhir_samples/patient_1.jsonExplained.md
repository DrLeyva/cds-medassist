## ðŸ§¾ patient_1.json â€” What Is This?

This file contains a sample **FHIR `Observation`** resource representing a patient's **systolic blood pressure reading**.

In real-world clinical systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner), patient data is often structured in this format and exchanged through secure APIs.
