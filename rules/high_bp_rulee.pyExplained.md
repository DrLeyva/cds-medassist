🔍 Line-by-Line Breakdown
def evaluate_bp(observation):
🔧 What it does:
Defines a function that takes a single observation object (FHIR Observation in dictionary format).

🧠 Why it matters:
This is your clinical decision logic — it analyzes the data and decides whether a recommendation should be triggered.

value = observation.get('valueQuantity', {}).get('value', 0)
🔍 What it does:
Safely pulls the numeric BP value from the observation dictionary:

First, it looks for the "valueQuantity" key

Then inside that, it looks for "value"

🛡️ Why this style is safe:
If either key is missing, it falls back to 0, avoiding a crash.

if value > 140:
📏 What it does:
Checks if the systolic blood pressure is greater than 140.

📋 Why it matters:
This is a clinical threshold — anything over 140 mmHg is often considered high and may need intervention.

return { ... }
📋 What it does:
If BP is high, it returns a dictionary representing a CDS Suggestion Card, including:

summary: Short title of the alert

detail: Explanation of the logic

indicator: Priority or severity level (e.g., warning)

🧠 Why it’s useful:
This format mimics real-world CDS Hooks responses, which clinicians can use at the point of care.

return None
🧼 What it does:
If no rule is triggered (BP ≤ 140), return None.

✅ Why it matters:
Returning None ensures that your main app knows not to display an alert.

🧠 Real-World Analogy
This function is like a nurse practitioner reading a blood pressure chart and deciding:

“Hmm, this is 150 mmHg — better notify the doctor with a recommendation.”

If the value is normal, it quietly says nothing.

✅ TL;DR Summary
The evaluate_bp() function:

Accepts a FHIR Observation dictionary

Checks if systolic blood pressure is > 140

If yes, returns a recommendation card (summary, detail, severity)

If no, returns None
